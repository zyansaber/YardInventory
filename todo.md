# Yard Inventory Report System - MVP Implementation

## Core Files to Create/Modify:
1. **src/firebase/config.js** - Firebase configuration and initialization
2. **src/firebase/database.js** - Firebase database operations (CRUD for yards and records)
3. **src/components/AdminSetup.jsx** - Page 1: Manage yards, set min/max, dealer types
4. **src/components/DataEntry.jsx** - Page 2: Inventory input with real-time status
5. **src/components/Analytics.jsx** - Page 3: Dashboard with charts and trends
6. **src/components/Navigation.jsx** - Tab navigation between pages
7. **src/App.jsx** - Main app with navigation state
8. **index.html** - Update title to "Yard Inventory Report System"

## Data Structure (Firebase Realtime Database):
- Yard: {YardName: {Company, Class, Min, Max}}
- weeklyRecords: {WeekStartDate: {records: [{dealer, stock, status, lastUpdated}]}}

## Key Features:
- Professional UI with Shadcn-UI components
- Real-time Firebase integration
- Three main pages with tab navigation
- Inventory status checking (within min/max range)
- Trend charts with missing data handling
- Responsive design

## Implementation Priority:
1. Firebase setup and database operations
2. Navigation structure
3. Admin page (yard management)
4. Data entry page (inventory input)
5. Analytics page (dashboard and charts)
